To fill the gap, we offer literacy classes for students in primary 3 to 5. We cover the alphabet, basic phonics, and use the <a href="https://readinguniverse.org/article/explore-teaching-topics/features-of-structured-literacy-instruction/what-is-structured-literacy" target="_blank">Structured Literacy</a> approach. This way, students can benefit from the books in our libraries and beyond.</p>`
